# Libft - Your very first own library

Description:
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

Many of the functions were already done during the piscine. However, this was a great opportunity
to update them, shrinking the code and making them more efficient. It was also the first contact
with lists.
